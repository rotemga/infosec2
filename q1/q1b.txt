Update first char (data[1]) to be the result of the xor.
I saw in the previous question, that msgcheck return true when the first char is equal to the xor result.
So, this change will cause the msg to be validate.
If the size is not good (size = data[0]), 
I fix the msg like the in q1c (but this is just in specific case, so this is completely differents solutions!)
